# assignementweek4-cleaning-data
Answer of the assignment from coursera
this repo is an application of the instruction of the assignement (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project)
The code gathers the training dataset and test dataset, and extractes partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.

the work done here is a combinaison from my personal efforts and the instructions given in the forum of discussions also from the work of some colleagues (gangxu79, mschroff,liangliangs);
thanks to our instructors in coursera and everyone making efforts to generalize the knowledge.
